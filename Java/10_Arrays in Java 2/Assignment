It seems like your message contains several typographical errors, making it difficult to understand your questions clearly. However, I will attempt to address the points you mentioned to the best of my ability.

1. **Default value of Array in different data types:**
   - For numeric types (like int, float), the default value is 0.
   - For boolean type, the default value is false.
   - For object references (like String), the default value is null.

2. **Finding the negative number in an array:**
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = {1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6};
        int count = 0;

        // Count the number of negative numbers in the array
        for (int num : array) {
            if (num < 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        // Create a new array to store negative numbers
        int[] negativeNumbers = new int[count];
        int index = 0;

        // Store negative numbers in the new array
        for (int num : array) {
            if (num < 0) {
                negativeNumbers[index] = num;
                index++;
            }
        }

        // Print negative numbers in the array
        System.out.print("Negative numbers in the array: ");
        for (int num : negativeNumbers) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}


3. **Where does Array stored in JVM memory:**
   In Java, arrays are objects, so they are stored in the heap memory of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

4. **Advantages and disadvantages of Array:**
   - **Advantages:** Arrays allow for easy storage and retrieval of elements based on index. They provide fast access to elements.
   - **Disadvantages:** Arrays in most programming languages have a fixed size, which means you need to know the size in advance. Resizing an array can be inefficient as it may require creating a new, larger array and copying elements.

5. **Anonymous Array in Java:**
   An anonymous array in Java is an array without a name. It is typically used for immediate array initialization. Here's an example of an anonymous array:
   ```java
   int[] numbers = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
   ```

6. **Different ways to traverse an Array in Java:**
   - **Using For Loop:**
   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
       // Access array[i] here
   }
   ```
   - **Using Enhanced For Loop (for-each loop):**
   ```java
   for (int num : array) {
       // Access num here
   }
   ```
   - **Using Streams (Java 8 onwards):**
   ```java
   Arrays.stream(array).forEach(num -> {
       // Access num here
   });
   ```

7. **Difference between length and length() in Java:**
   - `length`: It is a property of arrays in Java and provides the length (number of elements) of the array.
   - `length()`: It is a method of the String class in Java and provides the length (number of characters) of the string.
