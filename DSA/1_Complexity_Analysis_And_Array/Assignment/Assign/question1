Question 1. Analyze the time complexity of the following Java code and suggest a way to improve it: 

int sum = 0; 

for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { 

 for(int j = 1; j <= i; j++) { 

 sum++; 

 } 

}

above loop is giving sum of natural numbers
we can directly use (n*(n+1))/2
reduces complexity from O(n*n) to O(1)
